"Casper and other Proof-of-Stake protocols allow token holders to earn "

"**staking**. This tutorial shows you how to stake your Casper tokens with"

"We will use these terms interchangeably in this guide, but we will "
"explain the technical difference for clarity."

"Node operators stake their own tokens to earn the eligibility to propose "

" as validators. They also run and maintain servers connected to the "
"Casper Network. With these actions, node operators enable the Proof-of-"
"Stake aspect of the network. This process is different from mining "
"tokens. Validators thus earn rewards for participating and for securing "

"You can also participate in the protocol to earn rewards without "
"maintaining a Casper node (a server that stores a copy of the "

"tokens to a chosen node operator on the network. The node operator will "
"retain a commission, which is a percentage of the rewards generated from "
"your staked tokens. By participating in the protocol this way, you help "
"improve the network's decentralization and security and earn rewards in "
