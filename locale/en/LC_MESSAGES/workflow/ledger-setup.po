"A Ledger Device is a hardware wallet that is considered one of the most "
"secure ways to store your digital assets. Ledger uses an offline, or cold"
" storage, method of generating private keys, making it a preferred method"
" for many crypto users. This guide will help you to connect your Ledger "
"device to the Casper Web wallet (https://cspr.live). The Casper Web "
"wallet enables you to send and receive CSPR tokens."
